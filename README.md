Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tim. I'm a research assistant at [Corpus monodicum](https://corpus-monodicum.de) and am currently working on my doctoral thesis on Chant in the Medieval Ages from a statistical point of view. I am also interested in web development and machine learning.

## About Me
I am currently working on:

* A Bayesian Phylogenetic Model for a Collection of Medieval Chant Variants to Explore Different Historical Traces of Chants.
* A Paper about Network Modeling of the Transmission of Trope Elements 
* A Paper on determining played scales and their relationship to chords in jazz music (Corpus study derived from the Weimar Jazz Database) 
* MonodiKit, an interface that simplifies using Corpus monodicum data for digital corpus studies. Additionally, it serves as a conversion interface, enabling the transformation of the data into standardized formats such as MEI.
