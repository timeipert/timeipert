Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tim. I'm a research assistant at [Corpus monodicum](https://corpus-monodicum.de) and am currently working on my doctoral thesis on the topic of Modality in the Medieval Ages from a statistical point of view. I am also interested in web development and machine learning.

## About Me
I am currently working on:
* MonodiKit, an interface that simplifies the usage of Corpus monodicum data for digital corpus studies. Additionally, it serves as a conversion interface, enabling the transformation of the data into standardized formats such as MEI.
* A Paper about Network Modeling of the Transmission of Trope Elements 
* A Paper on determining played scales and their relationship to chords in jazz music (Corpus study derived from the Weimar Jazz Database) 
* My dissertation on approaches to model modality in medieval monophony.
